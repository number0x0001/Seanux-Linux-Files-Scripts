# Seanux-Linux-Project
These are programs that came with the Seanux Linux distrobution. Seanux is a distro by the Syrian Electronic Army that is no longe supported. These are some of the programs that came along installed on it. I am not responsible for any harm they may cause your system.

I found this operating system very interesting after the Syrian Electronic Army took all downloads down without a trace. After doing some exploring, I was able to successfully download it from an archive website. If you want to read more about it, please view some of these pages:
