# Seanux Linux Files & Scripts
These are programs that came with the Seanux Linux distrobution. Seanux is a distro by the Syrian Electronic Army that is no longe supported. These are some of the programs that came along installed on it. I am not responsible for any harm they may cause your system.

The entire operating system was very mysterious to me. It had many of the same tools as Kali or any other penetration testing distrobution would come with, but included other, "custom" tools. I haven't had time to look at them yet and have no clue what they do. My main question is - why would a hacker group like the Syrian Electronic Army make their operating system public? Is there a back door in it? Why did it vanish as suddenly as it came about? If you are lucky enough to find a download for the .iso file, I would highly recommend running it in a virtual environment and not connecting it to the internet. I was able to torrent the .iso and install the OS. That's where the files in this repo came from.
